### Monke Syntax Guide
This guide aims to provide a complete understanding of Monke's syntax.

# Notation in This Guide
This guide will use the characters `<>` to enclose something that you can change in your Monke source code. Anything that is optional will be enclosed in `[]` characters. You do not need to include these items, though you can if you wish.
```
<somethingYouCanChange> [<totallyOptional>]
```

# General Syntax
Comments in Monke are preceded by the backtick character, found to the left of the `1` key on QWERTY keyboards.
```
`This is a comment. Monke will completly ignore this.
```
All commands, variable declarations, and such are to be completed with a semicolon.
```
chatter("de wei of de M O N K E");
```
Code blocks are to be fenced wih brackets.
```
foo () : {
    chatter("This is foo");
}
```

# Variables
Variables in Monke are very simple. They can be declared using this syntax:
```
<varName> : [<type>] [= <value>];
`For Example:
a : int = 15;
a : str;
```
Declaration of the variable's type and initial value are not necessary.
